## Welcome to Lazarus!

Currently, not much happens here, but click the
button labeled "View On GitHub" to see available apps being hosted. 
You can download and install ALL (I mean all) of these apps at no cost.
Some of them even have source code hosted in the repo as well.
Come back and we may have more apps. I'm also looking for a way to list
apps inside of Jekyll. If anybody knows about that, please drop me a line.
